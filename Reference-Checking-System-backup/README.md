### System description in point form

- A reference checking system is a process that employers use to:
  
  > __verify the information provided by job candidates__
  
  > __gain additional insights into their past work performance__,
  
  > __strengths__,
  
  > __weaknesses__
  
  > __overall fit for a particular role__. 

- The system typically involves contacting the candidate's references - individuals who can vouch for the candidate's skills, experience, and character - and asking them a series of questions about the candidate's job performance, work habits, and other relevant factors. 

- The information obtained from the reference check is then used to assess the candidate's suitability for the role and to make informed hiring decisions. 

- A reference checking system can be an important tool for employers to ensure that they are hiring the most qualified and suitable candidates, and to minimize the risks of making a bad hire.



# System Objectives

1. Verification of Credentials: The primary objective of a reference checking system is to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the information provided by job applicants, such as their employment history, job titles, dates of employment, and educational qualifications.

2. Assessing Suitability: The system aims to assess the suitability of applicants for a particular role by gathering feedback from their previous employers or references. This feedback can provide insights into the candidate's skills, work ethic, attitude, and overall performance.

3. Confirming Experience: Reference checks help confirm the candidate's relevant work experience and determine if they possess the necessary skills and knowledge required for the position. This objective ensures that the candidate's claimed experience aligns with the job requirements.

4. Evaluating Performance: By gathering feedback from previous supervisors or colleagues, a reference checking system can evaluate the candidate's past performance, strengths, weaknesses, and overall abilities. This information aids in predicting their potential performance in the new role.

5. Cultural Fit: Assessing cultural fit is another objective of a reference checking system. It helps determine whether the candidate's values, work style, and interpersonal skills align with the organization's culture and team dynamics.

6. Reducing Hiring Risks: Reference checks aim to mitigate risks associated with hiring decisions by providing additional information about the candidate's reliability, integrity, and professionalism. This objective helps organizations make more informed hiring choices.

7. Identifying Discrepancies: Reference checking systems help identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies between the information provided by the applicant and the feedback received from references. This objective ensures that candidates are truthful during the application and interview process.

8. Legal and Compliance: Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is an important objective of a reference checking system. It helps organizations follow applicable laws, maintain fair employment practices, and protect against potential legal liabilities.

9. Enhancing Candidate Selection: By providing a comprehensive view of the candidate's background, skills, and qualifications, reference checks contribute to the overall selection process. This objective ensures that the most suitable candidates are chosen for the position.

10. Improving Hiring Decisions: Ultimately, the objective of a reference checking system is to improve the quality of hiring decisions. By gathering insights from reliable sources, organizations can make more informed choices and increase the likelihood of successful hires.

## Notifications and Reminders
- pending reference checks, upcoming deadlines, or follow-up actions required.

- Reference Request Reminder: The system can send a reminder to the user who initiated the reference check, prompting them to follow up with the referees who haven't responded yet. This reminder ensures that all necessary references are collected in a timely manner.

- Reference Submission Confirmation: Once a referee submits their reference feedback, the system can send a notification to the user or the candidate, confirming that the reference has been received successfully. This notification provides reassurance that the reference check process is progressing.

- Deadline Reminder: If there is a specific deadline for submitting reference feedback, the system can send a reminder to both the user and the referees a few days before the deadline. This reminder helps ensure that the references are provided within the specified timeframe.

- Reference Reminder to Referee: In case a referee has not yet responded to the reference request, the system can send a gentle reminder directly to the referee. This reminder encourages them to provide the reference feedback promptly and helps prevent delays in the reference-checking process.

- Reference Check Completion Notification: Once all the required references have been collected and the reference-checking process is complete, the system can send a notification to the user or the candidate, informing them that the reference check is finished. This notification signifies that all necessary information has been gathered, and the user or the candidate can proceed with the next steps in the hiring process.

- Reference Reminder to User/Candidate: If a referee has not responded to the reference request within a certain timeframe, the system can send a reminder to the user or candidate, notifying them about the pending reference. This reminder prompts them to follow up with the referee or consider alternative references if necessary.

- Reference Check Status Update: The system can send periodic status updates to the user or candidate, informing them about the progress of the reference check. These updates can provide details such as the number of references received, the number pending, and any outstanding actions required.

- Reference Review Reminder: After receiving reference feedback, the system can send a reminder to the user or recruiter to review the received references. This reminder ensures that the references are promptly reviewed and considered during the evaluation process.

- Reference Check Completion Summary: Once all references have been received and reviewed, the system can send a comprehensive summary report to the user or recruiter, consolidating all the reference feedback into a single document. This summary report aids in evaluating the candidate's qualifications and making informed decisions.

- Reference Expiration Reminder: If references have an expiration date or if the reference-checking process extends over a long period, the system can send a reminder to the user or recruiter when a reference is nearing its expiration. This reminder prompts them to consider updating or re-verifying the reference if needed.

- Reference Thank You Notification: After a reference has submitted their feedback, the system can automatically send a thank-you notification to the referee. This notification expresses gratitude for their time and contribution to the reference-checking process.

- Reference Quality Assurance Notification: In cases where the system detects incomplete or low-quality reference feedback, it can send a notification to the user or recruiter, alerting them to the issue. This notification prompts them to follow up with the referee for additional details or seek alternative references if necessary.
- Reference Check Progress Dashboard: The system can provide a real-time dashboard that displays the overall progress of the reference-checking process, including the number of initiated requests, pending responses, and completed references. This dashboard allows users or recruiters to track the status of multiple reference checks at a glance.
- 
- Reference Reminder Scheduling: To avoid overwhelming referees with multiple reminders within a short period, the system can implement intelligent scheduling. It ensures that reminder notifications are spaced out appropriately, preventing excessive reminders to referees who may need more time to provide their feedback.
- Reference Check Escalation Notification: In situations where a reference fails to respond despite multiple reminders, the system can send an escalation notification to the user or recruiter. This notification alerts them of the non-responsive reference, allowing them to take appropriate action, such as seeking an alternate reference.
